              The definition of the general "ProblemDetails" data structure from
              IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced inthis structure. Compared to the
              general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and
              "detail" attributes are mandated to be included by the present
              document, to ensure that the response contains additional textual
              information about an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees
              extensibility of the "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that
              particular APIs in the present document, or particular
              implementations, define extensions to define additional attributes
              that provide more information about the error. The description

              understanding of the design. For a full description, see IETF RFC

              The definition of the general "ProblemDetails" data structure from
              IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced inthis structure. Compared to the
              general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and

              extensibility of the "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that
              particular APIs in the present document, or particular

              that provide more information about the error. The description
