                        indicates that a service
                          affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                          is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
                          managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
                          to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                        * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a
                        service affecting
                          condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                          Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                          degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                          capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                        existence of a
                          non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action

                          service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                          example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                          the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                        detection of a
                          potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                          effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                          necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                          becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation

                      indicates that a service
                        affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                        is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a

                        to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                        becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation

                              to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a
                            service affecting
                              condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                              Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                              degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                              capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the
                            existence of a
                              non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                              should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                              service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                              example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                              the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the
                            detection of a
                              potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                              effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                              necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                              becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
                              X.733).
                            * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level
                            indicates that the
                              severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the
                            clearing of one or
                              more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this
                              managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and
                              Specific problems (if given) (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                              degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full

                              non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                              should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                              service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for

                              the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the

                              effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                              necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                              becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation

                              severity level indicates that a service
                                affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                                is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
                                managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
                                to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                              * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a
                              service affecting
                                condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                                Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                                degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                                capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                              * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the
                              existence of a
                                non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                                should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                                service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                                example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                                the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                              * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates
                              the detection of a
                                potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                                effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                                necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                                becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
                                X.733).
                              * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level
                              indicates that the
                                severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                              * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates
                              the clearing of one or
                                more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this

                              degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                              capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                              non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action

                              service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                              example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                              the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                            * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the

              IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced in this structure. Compared to
              the general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status"
              and "detail" attributes are mandated to be included by the present
              document, to ensure that the response contains additional textual
              information about an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees
              extensibility of the "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that
              particular APIs in the present document, or particular
              implementations, define extensions to define additional attributes
              that provide more information about the error. The description
              column only provides some explanation of the meaning to Facilitate
              understanding of the design. For a full description, see IETF RFC

                          indicates that a service
                            affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                            is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
                            managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
                            to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                          * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a
                          service affecting
                            condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                            Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                            degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                            capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                          * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the
                          existence of a
                            non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                            should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                            service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                            example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                            the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                          * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the
                          detection of a
                            potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                            effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                            necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                            becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
                            X.733).
                          * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level

                            severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                          * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the

        managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
        to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
      * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a service affecting
        condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
        Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
        degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
        capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
      * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a
        non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
        should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
        service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
        example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
        the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
      * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the detection of a
        potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
        effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
        necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
        becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
        X.733).
      * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level indicates that the
        severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
      * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of one or
        more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this
