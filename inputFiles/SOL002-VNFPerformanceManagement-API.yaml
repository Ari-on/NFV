              general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and

            description: >
              The hysteresis of the threshold. Shall be represented as a
              non-negative floating point number.
              A notification with crossing direction "UP" will be generated if
              the measured value reaches or exceeds
              "thresholdValue" + "hysteresis". A notification with crossing
              direction "DOWN" will be generated if the measured value reaches
              or undercuts "thresholdValue" - "hysteresis".
              The hysteresis is defined to prevent storms of threshold
              crossing notifications. When processing a request to create a
              threshold, implementations should enforce a suitable minimum
              value for this attribute (e.g. override the value or reject the
              request).
