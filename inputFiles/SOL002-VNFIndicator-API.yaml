  title: SOL002 - VNF Indicator interface
  description: >
    DRAFT VNF Indicator interface of ETSI NFV SOL002.

    This API allows the EM/VNF to provide information on value changes of VNF
    related indicators.  VNF related indicators are declared in the VNFD.


    IMPORTANT: Please note that this file might be not aligned to the current
    version of the ETSI Group Specification it refers to. In case of
    discrepancies the published ETSI Group Specification takes precedence.
