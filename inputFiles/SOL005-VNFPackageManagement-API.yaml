        The GET method reads the content of the VNFD within a VNF package.

        The VNFD can be implemented as a single file or as a collection of
        multiple files. If the VNFD is implemented in the form of multiple
        files, a ZIP file embedding these files shall be returned. If the VNFD
        is implemented as a single file, either that file or a ZIP file
        embedding that file shall be returned. The selection of the format is
        controlled by the "Accept" HTTP header passed in the GET request. • If
        the "Accept" header contains only "text/plain" and the VNFD is
        implemented as a single file, the file shall be returned; otherwise, an
        error message shall be returned. • If the "Accept" header contains only
        "application/zip", the single file or the multiple files that make up
        the VNFD shall be returned embedded in a ZIP file. • If the "Accept"
        header contains both "text/plain" and "application/zip", it is up to the
        NFVO to choose the format to return for a single-file VNFD; for a
        multi-file VNFD, a ZIP file shall be returned. The default format of the
        ZIP file shall be the one specified in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 [5] where
        only the YAML files representing the VNFD, and information necessary to
        navigate the ZIP file and to identify the file that is the entry point
        for parsing the VNFD (such as TOSCA-meta or manifest files or naming
        conventions) are included. This method shall follow the provisions
        specified in the Tables 9.4.4.3.2-1 and 9.4.4.3.2-2 for URI query
        parameters, request and response data structures, and response codes.

        provide duplicates of notifications to the OSS, and might make sense
        only in very rare use cases. Consequently, the NFVO may either allow

        with the same filter and callbackUri).
